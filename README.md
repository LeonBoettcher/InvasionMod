# The Goal
This project aims to revive the [Invasion Mod](https://github.com/Doenerstyle/Invasion-Mod), originally developed for Minecraft 1.7.10, and bring it to newer Minecraft versions. The mod had updates by [@Doenerstyle and others](https://github.com/Doenerstyle/Invasion-Mod) up to version 1.15.2, but my goal is to restore as many original features as possible while focusing on the core mechanics.
Current Minecraft Version 1.20.1
